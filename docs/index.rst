MoonPIES
========

The Moon Polar Ice and Ejecta Stratigraphy (MoonPIES) model is a Monte Carlo model that simulates the delivery and loss of ice and ejecta from lunar polar cold traps. The model was developed during the 2021 Exploration Science Summer Intern program at the Lunar and Planetary Institute and was funded by the NASA Center for Lunar Science and Exploration (CLSE) SSERVI node.

This project is maintained by Christian J. Tai Udovicic. Feel free to get in touch via the Issues Board for specific questions or email Christian directly at cjtu@nau.edu for help getting started.
